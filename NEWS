0.4

(Released on: Mon Sep 12 19:50:49 UTC 2011)

* Renamed package from usb-enumerator to usb-iteratee.
  This makes it more clear that this package provides iteratee
  enumerators instead of the enumerators from the enumerator package.

* Renamed System.USB.IO.Synchronous.Enumerator to System.USB.IO.Iteratee.

* The enumerators now use an asynchronous implementation when support
  for the GHC event manager is available. This should be more
  efficient.

* Support for an isochronous enumerator.
